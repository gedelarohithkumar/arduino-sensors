HOW IT WORKS:-

At its core, a humidity sensor measures the **amount of water vapor in the air** and converts that into an electrical signal that can be read and interpreted.

Let's take the capacitive type as an example:
1.Structure: It usually consists of two electrodes with a hygroscopic (moisture-absorbing) dielectric material in between.
2.How it reacts to humidity: As humidity increases, the dielectric constant of that moisture-sensitive material changes.
3.Electrical response: This change alters the capacitance between the electrodes. The sensor detects this shift and outputs a corresponding voltage or digital signal that represents the humidity level.

For a resistive type:
1.The sensor has a material whose electrical resistance changes depending on how much moisture it has absorbed from the air.
2.As humidity goes up, the resistance typically decreases, and that change is used to determine the relative humidity.

Thermal sensors are a bit different:
They use two thermistorsâ€”one exposed to air and the other sealed in dry gas. By comparing how the surrounding air affects their temperatures, the humidity level can be inferred.

Humidity sensors can be incredibly sensitive and accurate, especially when calibrated correctly. Many modern ones come bundled with a temperature sensor too, since temperature affects how much moisture air can hold.
