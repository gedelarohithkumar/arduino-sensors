Detect moisture levels in the air
A humidity sensor also known as a hygrometer is a device that detects and measures the amount of water vapor in the air. It plays a crucial role in applications ranging from weather monitoring and HVAC systems to industrial processes and even smart farming.
There are several types of humidity sensors, but the most common are:
Capacitive sensors: These measure humidity by detecting changes in electrical capacitance caused by moisture in a dielectric material.
Resistive sensors: These work by measuring changes in the electrical resistance of a hygroscopic (moisture-absorbing) material.
Thermal sensors: These measure humidity based on the difference in thermal conductivity between dry air and humid air.
Modern versions often come bundled with temperature sensors and are used in devices like air purifiers, thermostats, and smartphones. If you’re thinking of integrating one into a project or just curious about how they work.

HOW IT WORKS:-
Great follow-up! Here’s a breakdown of how a humidity sensor works:

At its core, a humidity sensor measures the **amount of water vapor in the air** and converts that into an electrical signal that can be read and interpreted.

Let's take the capacitive type as an example:
1.Structure: It usually consists of two electrodes with a hygroscopic (moisture-absorbing) dielectric material in between.
2.How it reacts to humidity: As humidity increases, the dielectric constant of that moisture-sensitive material changes.
3.Electrical response: This change alters the capacitance between the electrodes. The sensor detects this shift and outputs a corresponding voltage or digital signal that represents the humidity level.

For a resistive type:
1.The sensor has a material whose electrical resistance changes depending on how much moisture it has absorbed from the air.
2.As humidity goes up, the resistance typically decreases, and that change is used to determine the relative humidity.

Thermal sensors are a bit different:
They use two thermistors—one exposed to air and the other sealed in dry gas. By comparing how the surrounding air affects their temperatures, the humidity level can be inferred.

Humidity sensors can be incredibly sensitive and accurate, especially when calibrated correctly. Many modern ones come bundled with a temperature sensor too, since temperature affects how much moisture air can hold.
