ðŸ“Š Results

After uploading the code and opening the Serial Monitor (baud rate: 9600), the Arduino begins reading temperature and humidity values from the DHT11 sensor every 2 seconds.

Humidity: 58.00 %	Temperature: 27.00 Â°C / 80.60 Â°F
Humidity: 57.00 %	Temperature: 27.00 Â°C / 80.60 Â°F
Humidity: 56.00 %	Temperature: 26.00 Â°C / 78.80 Â°F
Humidity: 55.00 %	Temperature: 26.00 Â°C / 78.80 Â°F
Humidity: 55.00 %	Temperature: 25.00 Â°C / 77.00 Â°F

ðŸ“ˆ Observations

    The DHT11 sensor updates data every ~2 seconds.

    Small variations in readings occur due to environmental factors.

    If NaN (Not a Number) is received, it indicates a failed sensor read.

ðŸ“Œ Notes

    Ensure stable wiring; loose connections may cause read failures.

    Ideal operating range for DHT11:

        Temperature: 0â€“50 Â°C (Â±2 Â°C accuracy)

        Humidity: 20â€“90% RH (Â±5% accuracy)

    Use DHT22 for improved accuracy and range.
